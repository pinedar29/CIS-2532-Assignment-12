import sqlite3

# Connect to the SQLite database (books.db in this case)
connection = sqlite3.connect('books.db')

# Create a Cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Now you can execute SQL queries using the cursor
# Example: cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM your_table_name')

# Commit your changes if you made any modifications
connection.commit()

# Close the connection when you're done
connection.close()
